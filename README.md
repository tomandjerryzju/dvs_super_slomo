# Super-SloMo

This repository contains an Unofficial PyTorch implimentation of "Super SloMo: High Quality Estimation of Multiple Intermediate Frames for Video Interpolation", Jiang et. al. CVPR 2018

The repo is in it's initial stages. This can be used as a reference to build upon. I have tried to stick to the maths in the paper, but please let me know if any changes should be made.
